    "# Introduction\n",
    "* we look to intellignet software to automate routine labor, understand speech or images, make diagnoses in medicine and support basic scientific research.\n",
    "* Early days: problems that can be described by a list of formal, mathematical rules.\n",
    "* Now: allow computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierachy of concepts. We call this approach to __AI deep learning__.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __knowledge base__ approach to artificial intelligence: hard-code knowledge about the world in formal languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __machine learning__ acquire their own knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __logistic regression__, __naive Bayes__: simple ML algorithms, heavily depend on the representation of the data they are given (human made _features_ are given)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Many artificial intelligence tasks can be solved by designing the right set of features to extract for that task, then providing these features to a simple machine learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __representation learning__: Use machine learning to discover not only the mapping from representation to output but also the representation itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Goal: separate factors of variation, source of influence. Most applications require us to disentangle the factors of variation and discard the ones that we do not care about.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Deep learning__ solves this central problem in representation learning by introducing representations that are expressed in terms of other, simpler representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __multilayer perceptron (MLP)__: A mathematical function, formed by composing many simpler functions, mapping some set of input values to output values.We can think of each application of a different mathematical function as providing a new representation of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Networks with greater depth can execute more instructions in sequence. Sequential instructions offer great power because later instructions can refer back to the results of earlier instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* there is no single correct value for the depth of an architecture, nor is there a consensus about how much depth a model requires to qualify as “deep.”\n",
